    "Hydrology is the science of quantifying and understanding the water cycle and how that affects land surface and atmospheric processes. In this crucial crossroad era of climate change, hydrology is one of the principal domain of science that scientists are using to understand climate change impacts. Hydrologic processes are complex and highly data-driven. Due to shortage of in-situ estimates of hydrologic fluxes (precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, etc.), scientists are becoming more inclined to satellite-based estimates of these fluxes. Fortunately, advancement in space era is offering us with plenty of datasets, ushering the age of big data (remote sensing and geospatial datasets) in hydrology. \n",
    "\n",
    "These advancements have presented some new challenges. The traditional process-based (numerical/physical) models that hydrologists have been using are not suitable for handling the big data, either because of not being  computationally robust or the physics based equations in such models are not fitted for big data. These limitations have encouraged hydrologists to incorporate machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based models in hydrology. Such model are not dependent on process-based equations and offer high prediction accuracy. But still, it is crucial to understand the underlysing physical processes driving the predictions. Though some ML/DL methods offers shallow level insights of the physical processes, the increasing concern is how to improve ML/DL based methodologies that will be able to predict with high accuracy while following the process based mechanisms, providing scientists with information about involved hydrologic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this porject, I will discuss some recent papers of hydrologic ML/DL domain. Some of these research have developed models with high prediction accuracy but does not offer physical insights. On the other hand, some papers incorporate physical models with ML/DL approach, offering not only high accuracy predictions, but also provides good understanding of internal hydrologic process of the model."
